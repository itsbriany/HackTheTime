# HackTheTime
A repository dedicated to the NorthSec 2020 CTF Hack The Time challenge.

```bash
sha256sum time_server

```

Note that the checksum may differ from the original `time_server` binary offered by NorthSec because I processed the binary with [radare2](https://rada.re/n/) during the CTF.

If you don't trust the hash, you can contact the NorthSec 2020 CTF challenge designers for the `time_server` binary.
